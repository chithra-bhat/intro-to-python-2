## Course Projects

- **Photo Problem**: Organize photo files based on their descriptions, sorting them into respective folders.
- **Profanity Filter**: Replace offensive words in a text with asterisks (\*\*\*\*).
- **Rock Paper Scissors**: Implement the classic game, allowing players to choose their moves and determine the winner.


## Final Project - Rock Paper Scissors
The game of Rock Paper Scissors is a classic game played worldwide. It involves two players, each choosing one of three moves or "throws" — rock, paper, or scissors — in each round. Then, players reveal their moves at the same time. The following rules determine the outcome of each round:

- Rock beats scissors
- Paper beats rock
- Scissors beats paper
- If both players choose the same move, the round results in a tie.

## Game Options

Players can choose from various gameplay options, including:

- Single round
- Best of three rounds
- Custom number of rounds
